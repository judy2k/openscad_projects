# Croc Charm

Most Croc shoes have these neat holes in them that are meant for ventilation.
But you can also stuff little charms into them.
I wanted studs on my Crocs, so that's what I designed.

This model requires the [BOSL](https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL) library, because all my stuff does, these days.

# Printing

The charm prints in two parts.
Providing the `prepare` variable is `true`,
the rendered file should be ready to slice.

PLA should print fine at 0.2mm layer height, without any supports,
although I've reduced the layer height for the last few layers of the charm, to get a smoother curve on the stud point.
If you have adhesion issues on your bed, you *might* want a brim on the button/screw part, because it's tall with a relatively narrow base.
